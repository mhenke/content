Welcome to our Svelte tutorial! In this series, we'll build a complete web application using Svelte 5.19.0, learning about the key features and concepts along the way.

## Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Command line/terminal usage
- Modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
- Node.js and npm installed on your system

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that takes a unique approach to building web applications. Unlike traditional frameworks that do most of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

Key features in Svelte 5.19.0:
- Runes-based reactivity system with `$state` and `$derived`
- Improved TypeScript support
- Enhanced performance through compile-time optimizations
- Built-in state management
- Component-based architecture

## Installation and Setup

To create a new Svelte project, you can use:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template svelte
cd my-app
npm install
```

This command uses the latest version of Svelte (5.19.0) and provides more template options than before.

## Basic Component Structure

Here's a basic Svelte component using the new runes syntax:

```svelte
<script>
  import { $state, $derived } from 'svelte';
  
  let count = $state(0);
  $derived doubled = count * 2;
  
  function increment() {
    count++;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
  Count: {count}
</button>

<p>Doubled: {doubled}</p>

<style>
  button {
    padding: 8px 12px;
    background: #ff3e00;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
</style>
```

## Key Concepts

### State Management
Svelte 5.19.0 introduces runes for state management:
- `$state` for reactive variables
- `$derived` for computed values
- `$props` for component properties
- `$effect` for side effects

### Component Communication
Components can communicate through:
- Props using `$props`
- Events using `createEventDispatcher`
- Stores for global state management

### Styling
- Scoped by default to components
- Global styles can be added in public/global.css
- Dynamic styles supported through style directives

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, let's move on to building a practical application: a todo list that will help reinforce these concepts and introduce more advanced features.

In this article we'll provide a quick introduction to the [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/). We will see how Svelte works and what sets it apart from the rest of the frameworks and tools we've seen so far. Then we will learn how to set up our development environment, create a sample app, understand the structure of the project, and see how to run it locally and build it for production.

## Svelte: A new approach to building rich user interfaces

Svelte provides a different approach to building web apps than some of the other frameworks covered in this module. While frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the user's browser while the app is running, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens only when you build your app, producing highly optimized vanilla JavaScript.

The outcome of this approach is not only smaller application bundles and better performance, but also a developer experience that is more approachable for people that have limited experience of the modern tooling ecosystem.

Svelte sticks closely to the classic web development model of HTML, CSS, and JS, just adding a few extensions to HTML and JavaScript. It arguably has fewer concepts and tools to learn than some of the other framework options.

Its main current disadvantages are that it is a young framework â€” its ecosystem is therefore more limited in terms of tooling, support, plugins, clear usage patterns, etc. than more mature frameworks, and there are also fewer job opportunities. But its advantages should be enough to make you interested to explore it.

> [!NOTE]
> Svelte has [official TypeScript support](https://svelte.dev/docs/typescript). We'll look at it later on in this tutorial series.

We encourage you to go through the [Svelte tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/) for a really quick introduction to the basic concepts, before returning to this tutorial series to learn how to build something slightly more in-depth.

## Use cases

Svelte can be used to develop small pieces of an interface or whole applications. You can either start from scratch letting Svelte drive your UI or you can incrementally integrate it into an existing application.

Nevertheless, Svelte is particularly appropriate to tackle the following situations:

- Web applications intended for low-power devices: Applications built with Svelte have smaller bundle sizes, which is ideal for devices with slow network connections and limited processing power. Less code means fewer KB to download, parse, execute, and keep hanging around in memory.
- Highly interactive pages or complex visualizations: If you are building data-visualizations that need to display a large number of DOM elements, the performance gains that come from a framework with no runtime overhead will ensure that user interactions are snappy and responsive.
- Onboarding people with basic web development knowledge: Svelte has a shallow learning curve. Web developers with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge can easily grasp Svelte specifics in a short time and start building web applications.

The Svelte team launched [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), a framework for building web applications using Svelte. It contains features found in modern web frameworks, such as filesystem-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), page-specific rendering modes, offline support, and more. For more information about SvelteKit, see the [official tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/) and [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction).

Svelte is also available for mobile development via [Svelte Native](https://svelte-native.technology/).

## How does Svelte work?

Being a compiler, Svelte can extend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, generating optimal JavaScript code without any runtime overhead. To achieve this, Svelte extends vanilla web technologies in the following ways:

- It extends HTML by allowing JavaScript expressions in markup and providing directives to use conditions and loops, in a fashion similar to handlebars.
- It extends CSS by adding a scoping mechanism, allowing each component to define its own styles without the risk of clashing with other components' styles.
- It extends JavaScript by reinterpreting specific directives of the language to achieve true reactivity and ease component state management.

The compiler only intervenes in very specific situations and only in the context of Svelte components. Extensions to the JavaScript language are minimal and carefully picked in order not to break JavaScript syntax or alienate developers. In fact, you will be mostly working with vanilla JavaScript.

## First steps with Svelte

Since Svelte is a compiler, you can't just add a `<script src="svelte.js">` tag to your page and import it into your app. You'll have to set up your development environment in order to let the compiler do its job.

### Requirements

In order to work with Svelte, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. It's recommended that you use the long-term support (LTS) version. Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner). Note that you can also use the Yarn package manager in place of npm, but we'll assume you are using npm in this set of tutorials. See [Package management basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_tools/Package_management) for more information on npm and yarn.

If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you parity with Unix/macOS terminal in order to use the terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial. Gitbash (which comes as part of the [git for Windows toolset](https://gitforwindows.org/)) or [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) are both suitable. See [Command line crash course](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line) for more information on these, and on terminal commands in general.

Also see the following for more information:

- ["About npm"](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) on the npm documentation
- ["Introducing npx"](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner) on the npm blog

### Creating your first Svelte app

For this tutorial, we'll use SvelteKit with Svelte 5 beta, which introduces new features like runes for reactivity. Create a new project by running:

```bash
npx sv create moz-todo-svelte
cd moz-todo-svelte
npm install
```

When prompted, select the following options:
1. Which Svelte app template? â†’ `SvelteKit minimal`
2. Add type checking with TypeScript? â†’ `Yes, using TypeScript syntax`
3. Select additional options:
   - âœ“ Add Prettier for code formatting
   - âœ“ Add ESLint for code linting
   - âœ“ Add Playwright for browser testing
   - âœ“ Add Vitest for unit testing
4. Select package manager:
   - âœ“ Add npm

Then upgrade to Svelte 5 beta:
```bash
npm i -D svelte@next
```

> [!NOTE]
> Svelte 5 and its runes feature are currently in beta. While we'll use them in this tutorial to learn about the latest features, you might want to stick with Svelte 4 for production applications until version 5 is officially released.

After installation, you can optionally initialize a git repository:
```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Then start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```
> [!NOTE]
> When you first run the development server, you might see this warning:
> ```
> â–² [WARNING] Cannot find base config file "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json"
> ```
> This is normal on first run - SvelteKit will generate this file when it builds. The development server will run fine despite this warning.

### Application structure

A new SvelteKit project comes with the following structure:

```plain
moz-todo-svelte/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ svelte.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.cjs
â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierrc
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +page.svelte
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ +layout.svelte
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.html
â””â”€â”€ .svelte-kit/
```

The contents are as follows:

- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
- `svelte.config.js`: SvelteKit configuration
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite build tool configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `.eslintrc.cjs`: ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration
- `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright test configuration
- `static/`: Static assets that will be served as-is
- `tests/`: Test files
- `src/`: Your application source code
  - `lib/`: Reusable components and utilities
    - `components/`: Svelte components
    - `assets/`: Images and other assets
  - `routes/`: Pages and API routes (SvelteKit's file-based routing)
    - `+page.svelte`: The main page component
    - `+layout.svelte`: The layout component
  - `app.html`: The HTML template for your app

> [!NOTE]
> In SvelteKit, files that begin with `+` (like `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte`) are special routing files. The `+` prefix tells SvelteKit that these files have special meaning:
> - `+page.svelte` defines a page component that will be rendered at that route
> - `+layout.svelte` defines a layout that will wrap pages in that directory and its subdirectories
> These files are part of SvelteKit's file-based routing system, where the directory structure determines your app's routes.

## Having a look at our first Svelte component

Components are the building blocks of Svelte applications. They are written into `.svelte` files using a superset of HTML.

All three sections â€” `<script>`, `<style>`, and markup â€” are optional, and can appear in any order you like.

```html
<script>
  // logic goes here
</script>

<style>
  /* styles go here */
</style>

<!-- markup (zero or more HTML elements) goes here -->
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the component format, have a look at the [Svelte Components documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components).

With this in mind, let's have a look at the `src/routes/+page.svelte` file that came with the starter template. You should see something like the following:

```html
<h1>Welcome to SvelteKit</h1>
<p>Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to read the documentation</p>
```

This is a basic SvelteKit page component. Let's modify it to add some styling and interactivity:

```html
<script lang="ts">
  <script>
import { state } from 'svelte';
  
let name = state('world');
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
  <p>
    Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to read the documentation
  </p>
</main>

<style>
  main {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1em;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  h1 {
    color: #ff3e00;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 4em;
    font-weight: 100;
  }
</style>
```

### The `<script>` section

The `<script>` block contains JavaScript or TypeScript that runs when a component instance is created. In Svelte 5, we use runes for reactivity. Variables declared with `$state` are reactive by default. We'll explain in detail what this means later on.

```html
<script lang="ts">
  import { $state } from 'svelte';
  
  let name = $state('world');
</script>
```

### The markup section

In the markup section you can insert any HTML you like, and in addition you can insert valid JavaScript expressions inside single curly braces (`{}`). In this case we are embedding the value of the `name` prop right after the `Hello` text.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
  <p>
    Visit the <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/">Svelte tutorial</a> to learn
    how to build Svelte apps.
  </p>
</main>
```

Svelte also supports tags like `{#if}`, `{#each}`, and `{#await}` â€” these examples allow you to conditionally render a portion of the markup, iterate through a list of elements, and work with async values, respectively.

### The `<style>` section

If you have experience working with CSS, the following snippet should make sense:

```html
<style>
  main {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1em;
    max-width: 240px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  h1 {
    color: #ff3e00;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 4em;
    font-weight: 100;
  }

  @media (min-width: 640px) {
    main {
      max-width: none;
    }
  }
</style>
```

We are applying a style to our [`<h1>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) element. What will happen to other components with `<h1>` elements in them?

In Svelte, CSS inside a component's `<style>` block will be scoped only to that component. This works by adding a class to selected elements, which is based on a hash of the component styles.

You can see this in action by opening `localhost:8080` in a new browser tab, right/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-clicking on the _HELLO WORLD!_ label, and choosing _Inspect_:

![Svelte starter app with devtools open, showing classes for scoped styles](02-svelte-component-scoped-styles.png)

When compiling the app, Svelte changes our `h1` styles definition to `h1.svelte-1tky8bj`, and then modifies every `<h1>` element in our component to `<h1 class="svelte-1tky8bj">`, so that it picks up the styles as required.

> [!NOTE]
> You can override this behavior and apply styles to a selector globally using the `:global()` modifier (see the [Svelte `<style>` docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components#style) for more information).

## Making a couple of changes

Now that we have a general idea of how it all fits together, we can start making a few changes.
At this point you can try updating your `App.svelte` component â€” for example change the `<h1>` element in `App.svelte` so that it reads like this:

```html
<h1>Hello {name} from MDN!</h1>
```

Just save your changes and the app running at `localhost:8080` will be automatically updated.

### A first look at Svelte reactivity

In the context of a UI framework, reactivity means that the framework can automatically update the DOM when the state of any component is changed.

In Svelte, reactivity is triggered by assigning a new value to any top-level variable in a component. For example, we could include a `toggleName()` function in our `App` component, and a button to run it.

Try updating your `<script>` and markup sections like so:

```html
<script>
  export let name;

  function toggleName() {
    if (name === "world") {
      name = "Svelte";
    } else {
      name = "world";
    }
  }
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
  <button on:click="{toggleName}">Toggle name</button>
  <p>
    Visit the <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/">Svelte tutorial</a> to learn
    how to build Svelte apps.
  </p>
</main>
```

Whenever the button is clicked, Svelte executes the `toggleName()` function, which in turn updates the value of the `name` variable.

As you can see, the `<h1>` label is automatically updated. Behind the scenes, Svelte created the JavaScript code to update the DOM whenever the value of the name variable changes, without using any virtual DOM or other complex reconciliation mechanism.

Note the use of `:` in `on:click`. That's Svelte's syntax for listening to DOM events.

## Inspecting main.js: the entry point of our app

Let's open `src/main.js`, which is where the `App` component is being imported and used. This file is the entry point for our app, and it initially looks like this:

```js
import App from "./App.svelte";

const app = new App({
  target: document.body,
  props: {
    name: "world",
  },
});

export default app;
```

`main.js` starts by importing the Svelte component that we are going to use. Then it gets instantiated with `new App`, passing an option object with the following properties:

- `target`: The DOM element inside which we want the component to be rendered, in this case the `<body>` element.
- `props`: the values to assign to each prop of the `App` component.

## A look under the hood

How does Svelte manage to make all these files work together nicely?

The Svelte compiler processes the `<style>` section of every component and compiles them into the `public/build/bundle.css` file.

It also compiles the markup and `<script>` section of every component and stores the result in `public/build/bundle.js`. It also adds the code in `src/main.js` to reference the features of each component.

Finally the file `public/index.html` includes the generated `bundle.css` and `bundle.js` files:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />

    <title>Svelte app</title>

    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/global.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/build/bundle.css" />

    <script defer src="/build/bundle.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body></body>
</html>
```

The minified version of `bundle.js` weighs a little more than 3KB, which includes the "Svelte runtime" (just 300 lines of JavaScript code) and the `App.svelte` compiled component. As you can see, `bundle.js` is the only JavaScript file referenced by `index.html`. There are no other libraries loaded into the web page.

This is a much smaller footprint than compiled bundles from other frameworks. Take into account that, in the case of code bundles, it's not just the size of the files you have to download that matter. This is executable code that needs to be parsed, executed, and kept in memory. So this really makes a difference, especially in low-powered devices or CPU-intensive applications.

## Following this tutorial

In this tutorial series you will be building a complete web application using Svelte 5.19.0. We'll learn all the basics about Svelte and also quite a few advanced topics.

You can follow along in two ways:

1. **Using Vite locally**:
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-svelte-app -- --template svelte
cd my-svelte-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. **Using the Svelte REPL**:
Visit [svelte.dev/repl](https://svelte.dev/repl) to code along in your browser without installing anything.

Each article will include:
- A link to the starting code in the REPL
- Instructions for creating the necessary files and components
- Clear explanations of new concepts
- Code snippets you can copy and paste

> [!NOTE]
> While the original tutorial used a specific GitHub repository, we've updated the content to use Vite, which is the current recommended way to create Svelte applications. The concepts and components remain the same, just in a modern project structure.

### Using the Svelte REPL

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is Svelte's online playground. It's perfect for:
- Experimenting with Svelte features
- Sharing code examples
- Testing ideas without local setup
- Following along with tutorials

To use the REPL:
1. Visit [svelte.dev/repl](https://svelte.dev/repl)
2. Create new `.svelte` files using the + button
3. Write your components
4. See the live result on the right

Each article will include a REPL link with the starting code for that section.

## The code so far

### Local Development

To get started with the code locally:

```bash
# Create a new Svelte project
npm create vite@latest my-svelte-app -- --template svelte
cd my-svelte-app
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### REPL

To see the current state of the code in the REPL, visit:

<https://svelte.dev/repl/fc68b4f059d34b9c84fa042d1cce586c?version=5.19.0>

## Summary

This brings us to the end of our initial look at Svelte, including how to set up a new project using Vite, create components, and understand the basics. In the next article, we'll start building our first proper application, a todo list. Before we do that, however, let's recap some of the things we've learned.

In Svelte:

- We define the script, style, and markup of each component in a single `.svelte` file
- Components use the new runes system (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`) for reactivity
- Component props are declared using the `$props` rune
- Svelte components can be used just by importing the corresponding `.svelte` file
- Components styles are scoped, keeping them from clashing with each other
- In the markup section you can include any JavaScript expression by putting it between curly braces
- Reactivity is handled through runes and state updates
- The development environment is powered by Vite for fast development and optimized builds
